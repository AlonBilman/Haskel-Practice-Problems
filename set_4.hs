{-Write a function invert, which takes a list [t], and a pair (a,b) of
integers. The function will return Either String t. If a and b are valid
indices, the function will return Right [t] â€“ where [t] is a list in which
the items in indices a and b will exchange places. If either a or b is not
valid, the function will return Left s, where s is a string describing the
problem. -}
